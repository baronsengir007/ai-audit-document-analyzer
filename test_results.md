| Security Audit Report | audit_report | audit_report | 0.82 | ✅ PASS |
| Business Continuity Plan | business_continuity_plan | business_continuity_plan | 0.87 | ✅ PASS |

The system correctly classified all standard documents with high confidence scores (>0.8), demonstrating strong performance on documents containing expected key phrases and structural elements.

### Evidence Extraction

The system successfully extracted relevant evidence from classified documents, with examples including:

- **Privacy Policy:**
  - "We collect the following types of personal information..."
  - "Your data is processed according to the following principles..."
  - "Data subject rights include access, correction, and deletion..."

- **Information Security Policy:**
  - "Access control requirements for all systems..."
  - "Password management guidelines include complexity requirements..."
  - "Data shall be encrypted during transmission and at rest..."

- **Incident Response Plan:**
  - "The incident response team shall be notified immediately..."
  - "Incidents shall be categorized according to the following severity levels..."
  - "Evidence preservation guidelines must be followed..."

Evidence extraction was consistently aligned with the classification results, providing clear justification for the assigned document types.

### Edge Case Handling

| Edge Case | Expected Result | Actual Result | Confidence | Status |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------|------------|--------|
| Mixed Compliance Policy | Multiple or uncertain | security_policy (primary) with lower confidence | 0.62 | ✅ PASS |
| Partial Password Policy | security_policy with low confidence | security_policy | 0.45 | ✅ PASS |
| Empty Document | Error or unclassified | unknown | 0.21 | ✅ PASS |
| Quarterly Report | Unclassified or low confidence | unknown | 0.28 | ✅ PASS |
| Malformed Document | Error or partial match | Error with graceful handling | N/A | ✅ PASS |

The system appropriately handled edge cases by:
- Assigning lower confidence scores to ambiguous documents
- Correctly identifying the dominant document type in mixed content
- Classifying documents with minimal content with appropriately low confidence
- Properly handling empty or irrelevant documents
- Gracefully managing malformed content with appropriate error handling

## Coverage Analysis

### Document Type Coverage

When tested with a complete document set, the system reported:

- **Required Document Types:** 5/5 (100% coverage)
- **Optional Document Types:** 3/3 (100% coverage)
- **Overall Coverage Score:** 100%

When tested with missing documents (by filtering out privacy policy documents), the system correctly:

- Identified the missing document type (privacy_policy)
- Reported reduced coverage (80% - 4/5 required documents)
- Listed the missing document in the HTML and JSON reports
- Provided appropriate warning indicators in the dashboard

### Missing Document Identification

The system successfully identified missing required documents in partial document sets:

1. **Test Scenario:** Filter out privacy policy documents
   - **Expected Result:** privacy_policy identified as missing
   - **Actual Result:** privacy_policy correctly identified as missing
   - **Report Indication:** Clear indication in both HTML and JSON reports

2. **Test Scenario:** Filter out incident response documents
   - **Expected Result:** incident_response_plan identified as missing
   - **Actual Result:** incident_response_plan correctly identified as missing
   - **Report Indication:** Clear indication in both HTML and JSON reports

These results confirm that the system fulfills its primary auditor use case of identifying missing required documents from a collection.

## Report Generation

### HTML Report

The HTML report was successfully generated and verified to include:

- Dashboard with coverage metrics
- Complete list of found document types with evidence
- Clear highlighting of missing required document types
- Detailed document classification results with confidence scores
- Appropriate styling and formatting for readability
- Interactive elements for expanding/collapsing sections

The HTML report contained comprehensive information presented in a user-friendly format suitable for auditors and compliance officers.

### JSON Report

The JSON report was successfully generated and verified to include:

- Structured data with all required sections
- Summary metrics including coverage percentage
- Complete document list with classification results
- Evidence extracts for each classified document
- Confidence scores for each classification
- Missing document indicators

The JSON report format enables programmatic integration with other tools and systems.

## Performance Metrics

### Processing Time

- **Average Document Processing Time:** ~0.15 seconds per document
- **Classification Time (LLM):** ~0.5 seconds per document
- **Total Pipeline Execution (15 documents):** ~10 seconds

The system demonstrated acceptable performance for the test document set, with no significant bottlenecks identified.

### Confidence Score Distribution

- **Well-Matched Documents:** 0.85-0.95
- **Partial Matches:** 0.45-0.7
- **Poor Matches:** <0.3

The confidence scoring mechanism appropriately differentiated between high-quality, partial, and poor matches, providing useful signals for document classification reliability.

## Areas for Improvement

### 1. Confidence Calibration

**Finding:** Confidence scores, while generally appropriate, could benefit from better calibration. Some documents with mixed content received relatively high confidence scores despite ambiguity.

**Recommendation:** Implement a confidence calibration mechanism that compares document content against multiple document types to better identify ambiguous documents. Consider adding a secondary confidence metric for content exclusivity.

**Implementation:** Update the `semantic_classifier.py` module to calculate confidence based on both positive matches and negative evidence against alternative types.

### 2. Evidence Extraction Enhancement

**Finding:** Evidence extraction, while functional, sometimes includes generic phrases rather than the most distinctive content.

**Recommendation:** Enhance the evidence extraction logic to prioritize sentences with higher information density and discriminative power between document types.

**Implementation:** Modify the LLM prompting in `llm_wrapper.py` to specifically request the most distinctive and unique evidence from documents.

### 3. Edge Case Detection

**Finding:** The system correctly handles edge cases but doesn't explicitly flag them as potential issues requiring review.

**Recommendation:** Add an explicit "requires_review" flag for documents with unusual characteristics, medium confidence scores, or mixed content signals.

**Implementation:** Extend the classification result schema to include a "requires_review" field and implement logic in `semantic_classifier.py` to set this flag based on document characteristics.

### 4. Performance Optimization

**Finding:** Document processing time is acceptable but could be improved, particularly for large documents.

**Recommendation:** Implement text chunking for large documents and explore batch processing of multiple documents to improve LLM utilization.

**Implementation:** Add text chunking in `document_processor.py` and batch processing capabilities in `main.py`.

### 5. Report Customization

**Finding:** Reports provide comprehensive information but lack customization options.

**Recommendation:** Add report template customization and filtering options to tailor outputs for different stakeholders.

**Implementation:** Enhance `results_visualizer.py` with template selection and filtering parameters.
